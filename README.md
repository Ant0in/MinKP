# 🧳 MinKP Solver

Welcome to the **MinKP Solver**! This project focuses on solving the **Minimum Knapsack Problem** (MinKP). The goal is to minimize the total cost of selected items while respecting weight constraints across one or more knapsacks.

## 📜 Description

This project implements a **Python-based solution** for the **MinKP** using optimization techniques such as **Linear Programming** (LP) and **Integer Programming** (IP), leveraging the **PuLP** library.

For more detailed problem specifications and additional information, please refer to the accompanying documentation: `./pdf/consignes.pdf`.

## 🚀 Features

- Solves **Single Knapsack** and **Multiple Knapsack** versions of the problem.
- Supports **Primal Integer Solution**, **Primal Relaxed Solution**, and **Dual Relaxed Solution**.
- Implements **linear programming** optimization using **PuLP**.

## ⚙️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Ant0in/MinKP.git
    cd MinKP
    ```

2. Set up a **virtual environment**:

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. If you don't have `requirements.txt`, you can manually install **PuLP** and **pytest**:

    ```bash
    pip install pulp pytest
    ```

## 🛠️ Usage

### Running the Solver

To run the solver, you can use the following:

```bash
python3 src/minKP.py ./my/kp/fp/data.txt 0  # -v flag can be added for extra verbose
```

Where:

- **`./my/kp/fp/data.txt`** is the **path** to the input file containing the **knapsack problem data**.
- **`0`** is the **mode** of the solver (choose between *0*, *1*, or *2*):
    - **0**: Primal Integer Solution.
    - **1**: Primal Relaxed Solution.
    - **2**: Dual Relaxed Solution.

## 🧪 Testing with pytest

To run the tests for the project, use the following command:

```bash
pytest  # -vvv flag can be added for extra verbose
```

This will automatically run all the unit tests and provide feedback.
